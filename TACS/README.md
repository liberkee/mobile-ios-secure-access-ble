## Build instructions
### Create binary framework
You can create the framework by running
```bash
carthage build --no-skip-current
```
in the project root.

The output can be found in `Carthage/Build/iOS` folder by default.
### Installation

To install the framework in the project via Cocoapods
* copy contents of `Carthage/Build/iOS` and `distribution` folders in one folder, e.g. `Libs/TACS` 
* reference the folder in your project

Since both `SecureAccessBLE` and `TACS` frameworks are necessary, a `Podfile` would look like

```ruby
pod 'SecureAccessBLE', :path => '../Libs/SecureAccessBLE' # Refer to Readme.md of SecureAccessBLE for more options on this.
pod 'TACS', :path => '../Libs/TACS'
```

Run 
```ruby
pod install
```
in your project root.

### Documentation
This project uses [Jazzy](https://github.com/realm/jazzy) to generate the documentation. To update the documentation you need to:

- Run `bundle install` to install the jazzy gem
- Run `jazzy` to generate the documentation
